    Madrid (/məˈdrɪd/ ⓘ mə-DRID; Spanish: [maˈðɾið ⓘ)[n. 1] is the capital and most populous municipality of Spain. It has almost 3.4 million[10] inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of approximately 7 million. It is the second-largest city in the European Union (EU), and its monocentric metropolitan area is the second-largest in the EU.[2][11][12] The municipality covers 604.3 km2 (233.3 sq mi) geographical area.[13] Madrid lies on the River Manzanares in the central part of the Iberian Peninsula at about 650 meters above mean sea level. The capital city of both Spain and the surrounding autonomous community of Madrid (since 1983),[14]: 44  it is also the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country.[15] The climate of Madrid features hot summers and cool winters. The primitive core of Madrid, a walled military outpost, dates back to the late 9th century, under the Emirate of Córdoba. Conquered by Christians in 1083 or 1085, it consolidated in the Late Middle Ages as a sizeable town of the Crown of Castile. The development of Madrid as administrative centre fostered after 1561, as it became the permanent seat of the court of the Hispanic Monarchy.

     all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities.[16][17]
      Madrid is considered the major financial centre[18] 
      and the leading economic hub of the Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe.[19][17]
       The metropolitan area hosts major Spanish companies such as Telefónica, Iberia, BBVA and FCC.[14]: 45  
       It concentrates the bulk of banking operations in the country and it is the Spanish-speaking city
        generating the largest number of webpages.[14]: 45
